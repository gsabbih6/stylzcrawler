# stylzcrawler
This java code is used to crawl and scrape websites for fashion data. I have only implement crawilg for a single website 'Diyanu.com'. 
However most fashion websites have the html structure and you can add more if neccssary.

This code came out of a personal project that I am working on. The crawl is based on crawler4j and jsoup. Enjoy
